# EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification

This project involves using deep learning techniques to classify motor imagery EEG signals (left vs. right hand movement imagery) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model predicts motor intent from EEG data and is evaluated on a test dataset.

## üß† Project Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are used to interpret motor intentions in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This project aims to:

- Preprocess EEG data  
- Train a deep CNN model  
- Classify motor imagery (left vs. right)  
- Visualize model predictions and performance  

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- Input shape: `(n_channels, n_times)` per trial  
- Channels used: `ch3`, `ch4`, `ch5`  
- Labels:  
  - `0` = Left imagery  
  - `1` = Right imagery  
- Data is structured into trials with temporal sequences

## üß† Model Architecture

The deep learning architecture consists of temporal and spatial convolutional layers followed by pooling, dropout, and a dense classification layer.
